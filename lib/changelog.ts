  {
    version: '1.0.104',
    date: '2026-03-06',
    changes: [
      { type: 'feat', description: '**RTA threshold line overlay**: Display effective detection threshold as dashed blue line on RTA graph with right-aligned label' },
      { type: 'ui', description: '**Show on RTA toggle**: New switch under Threshold slider to show/hide threshold line' },
    ],
  },
  {
    version: '1.0.70',
    date: '2026-03-05',
    changes: [
      { type: 'feat', description: '**Low-frequency detection restored**: Removed erroneous 400 Hz hard floor, use actual peak frequency in prominence gate instead of worst-case 150 Hz proxy, reduced LOW band multipliers (prominence 1.4x→1.15x, sustain 1.5x→1.2x) to prevent triple-stacking penalties' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '**Advisory card dedup**: Frequency-proximity matching (200 cents) in React handler replaces same-frequency cards instead of accumulating duplicates; cards persist on clear as requested' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '[ ] Start analysis with a mic near a monitor speaker — verify feedback below 400 Hz is detected and shown' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '[ ] Verify no duplicate advisory cards appear for the same frequency' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '[ ] Verify advisory cards persist (don\'t disappear) when feedback stops momentarily' },
    ],
  },
  {
    version: '1.0.69',
    date: '2026-03-05',
    changes: [
      { type: 'feat', description: '**Low-frequency detection**: Reduced Schroeder room-mode penalty from -0.25 to -0.12 — the old value consumed 76% of starting feedback probability, making sub-300 Hz detection nearly impossible even with strong positive signals (high MSD, sustained growth, high Q). The prominence floor scaling (up to 1.5× via modal density) and LOW band multipliers (1.4× prominence, 1.5× sustain) already provide robust room-mode filtering.' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '**Prominence floor sync**: Changed hardcoded 10 dB base in `shouldReportIssue()` to use `settings.prominenceDb` so the reporting gate stays in sync with the detection gate (Speech preset uses 8 dB).' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '**Duplicate advisories**: `onAdvisoryCleared` was a no-op in React state — when the worker cleared and re-detected the same frequency, both advisory cards accumulated. Now properly removes cleared advisories by ID.' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '[ ] Verify low-frequency feedback (<300 Hz) is detected in Speech mode at a live venue' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '[ ] Confirm no duplicate advisory cards appear for the same frequency' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '[ ] Verify room modes are still filtered (not every low-freq peak should trigger)' },
      { type: 'feat', description: '[ ] Run `npx tsc --noEmit && pnpm build` — both pass' },
    ],

      { type: 'feat', description: 'Implemented PHPR (Peak-to-Harmonic Power Ratio) detection — feedback is sinusoidal (no harmonics), music has rich harmonics; used as soft confidence boost in classifier' },
