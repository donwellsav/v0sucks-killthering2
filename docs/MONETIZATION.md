## 1. Market Opportunity

### 1.1 The Problem

Every live sound engineer faces acoustic feedback. It's the single most common problem in live audio — from church worship teams running a handful of open mics to touring engineers managing 40+ channels at festivals. The current solutions fall into two camps:

1. **Hardware boxes** (dbx AFS2, Sabine FBX, Klark Teknik DF1000) — $200-600, dedicated hardware, no analysis or education, must be carried/installed
2. **DAW plugins** (Waves Feedback Hunter, X-FDBK, AlphaLabs De-Feedback) — $80-150, require a plugin host (laptop + audio interface + DAW), not mobile

**Neither camp offers:** a zero-install, mobile-ready, educational, analysis-focused tool that works on any device with a browser.

### 1.2 Total Addressable Market (TAM)

| Segment | Estimated Size (Global) | Annual Spend on Audio Tools | KTR Potential |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Churches/worship | ~400,000 with sound systems | $500-5,000/year on tech | Very High |
| Freelance live sound | ~200,000 active | $1,000-10,000/year on tools | High |
| Small-medium venues | ~300,000 globally | $2,000-20,000/year on tech | High |
| Corporate AV teams | ~100,000 teams | $5,000-50,000/year | Medium |
| Touring professionals | ~50,000 globally | $5,000-20,000/year | Medium |
| System integrators | ~20,000 companies | $10,000-100,000/year | Medium |
| Audio education | ~5,000 institutions | $1,000-10,000/year | Low-Medium |

**Conservative serviceable addressable market (SAM):** 200,000+ potential users in the first 3 years

### 1.3 Why Now

1. **PWAs are mature** — installable, offline-capable, indistinguishable from native apps
2. **Web Audio API is stable** — reliable audio processing in the browser
3. **Mobile devices are powerful enough** — modern phones handle real-time FFT at 25fps
4. **No SaaS player exists** in this niche — all competitors are one-time-purchase plugins or hardware
5. **Church tech is modernizing** — volunteer-driven teams actively adopting digital tools
6. **AI-enhanced analysis** — impossible 5 years ago, now runs in a Web Worker

## 2. Competitive Pricing Analysis

### 2.1 Current Market Pricing

| Product | Type | Price | Model | Target |
|---------|------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Waves Feedback Hunter** | VST plugin | $99-149 | One-time (or included in $199/yr Ultimate sub) | Live sound engineers |
| **Waves X-FDBK** | VST plugin | $79-149 | One-time (or included in Ultimate sub) | Live engineers with DAW |
| **AlphaLabs De-Feedback** | VST plugin | ~$99 | One-time | Engineers with NUC hardware |
| **dbx AFS2** | Hardware | $300-400 | One-time (hardware) | Installed systems |
| **Sabine FBX series** | Hardware | $200-400 | One-time (hardware) | Installed systems |
| **Klark Teknik DF1000** | Hardware | $200-300 | One-time (hardware) | Budget installations |
| **Smaart (Rational Acoustics)** | Analysis software | $800-1,200 | One-time + $295/yr updates | System engineers |
| **REW (Room EQ Wizard)** | Analysis software | Free | Open source | Hobbyists/education |

### 2.2 Key Pricing Insights

1. **One-time purchase dominates** — the pro audio market is accustomed to one-time purchases (plugins, hardware). SaaS subscriptions are newer and less accepted.
2. **Waves Ultimate subscription** ($199/year for 230+ plugins) has normalized subscriptions for the Waves ecosystem.
3. **Smaart** at $800-1,200 shows that professionals will pay premium for quality analysis software.
4. **REW being free** shows that a powerful free tier can build massive community adoption.
5. **Churches are budget-conscious** but increasingly adopt subscription tools (Planning Center, ProPresenter licenses).

### 2.3 Pricing Strategy Rationale

Kill The Ring should use a **freemium model with optional subscriptions** rather than one-time purchase because:

1. **Zero friction for adoption** — free tier removes all barriers
2. **Recurring revenue** — more valuable than one-time sales for sustainability
3. **Feature expansion justifies ongoing cost** — unlike a static plugin, KTR continuously improves
4. **Church/education markets** prefer predictable monthly costs over large upfront purchases
5. **Data flywheel** — more users = more spectral data = better algorithms = more value

## 4. Feature Gating Strategy

### 4.1 Gating Principles

1. **Detection quality is never gated** — all 7 algorithms run at full quality on all tiers. This is the ethical and smart choice. Degrading detection quality for free users creates safety concerns (missed feedback can damage speakers/hearing) and breeds resentment.

2. **Analysis depth is gated** — free users see "what" (frequency + severity), Pro users see "why and how" (EQ recommendations, algorithm breakdown, trends), Enterprise users see "across the system" (multi-channel, mixer integration).

3. **Persistence is gated** — free users get ephemeral analysis (current session only), Pro users get session recording and room profiles, Enterprise users get historical analytics.

4. **Integration is gated** — mixer control, Companion, API access are Enterprise-only. These have real infrastructure costs and target high-value users.

### 4.3 Conversion Triggers

Key moments where free users experience the value of upgrading:

1. **"You caught 6 feedback frequencies — upgrade to track unlimited"** — hitting the 5-advisory cap during a show
2. **"That was a great session — save it for next time?"** — end-of-session prompt to save/export
3. **"This frequency rang 3 times tonight — see the pattern"** — teaser of historical analytics
4. **"Recommended: -4.2dB at 2,512 Hz, Q=8.3"** — showing the recommendation exists but blurring the details
5. **"Your room has consistent problems at 800 Hz and 3.15 kHz"** — room profile teaser

---

## 8. Implementation Plan

### 8.1 Payment Infrastructure

**Recommended: Stripe**

1. **Stripe Checkout** — hosted payment page (PCI-compliant, no card handling)
2. **Stripe Billing** — subscription management, invoicing, proration
3. **Stripe Customer Portal** — self-service subscription management
4. **Stripe Webhooks** — sync subscription status to Supabase

**Implementation files:**
- `app/api/v1/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — Stripe webhook handler
- `app/api/v1/stripe/checkout/route.ts` — Create checkout session
- `app/api/v1/stripe/portal/route.ts` — Customer portal redirect
- `lib/stripe/` — Stripe client, price IDs, subscription helpers
- `types/subscription.ts` — Subscription types, tier definitions
- `hooks/useSubscription.ts` — Client-side subscription state

### 8.2 User Authentication

**Recommended: Supabase Auth**

1. **Email + password** — standard signup
2. **Google OAuth** — frictionless for personal Gmail users
3. **Magic link** — passwordless for tech-averse church volunteers
4. **Anonymous upgrade** — start free without account, prompted to create account when hitting Pro features

**Implementation files:**
- `lib/auth/supabaseClient.ts` — Supabase client initialization
- `lib/auth/authHelpers.ts` — Auth utility functions
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` — Authentication state context
- `hooks/useAuth.ts` — Auth hook with login/logout/signup
- `components/kill-the-ring/AuthDialog.tsx` — Login/signup modal
- `middleware.ts` — Route protection for Pro/Enterprise features

### 8.3 Feature Gating Implementation

```typescript
// types/subscription.ts
export type SubscriptionTier = 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise'

export interface UserSubscription {
  tier: SubscriptionTier
  status: 'active' | 'past_due' | 'canceled' | 'trialing'
  currentPeriodEnd: Date
  cancelAtPeriodEnd: boolean
}

// Usage in components:
// const { tier } = useSubscription()
// if (tier === 'free') { showUpgradePrompt() }
```

**Gating pattern:** Check tier in the hook/context, not in individual components. Components call `useSubscription()` and conditionally render upgrade prompts.

### 8.4 Implementation Priority

| # | Task | Effort | Dependency | Revenue Impact |
|---|------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Stripe integration | 3-5 days | None | Direct — enables payment |
| 2 | Supabase Auth | 3-5 days | None | Direct — enables accounts |
| 3 | Subscription context + tier gating | 2-3 days | 1, 2 | Direct — enables gating |
| 4 | Session recording + cloud storage | 5-7 days | 2 | High — key Pro feature |
| 5 | Upgrade prompts at gate points | 2-3 days | 3 | High — drives conversion |
| 6 | Customer portal + billing management | 1-2 days | 1 | Medium — reduces churn |
| 7 | Church/education discount flow | 1-2 days | 1, 3 | Medium — captures segment |
| 8 | Stripe webhooks + status sync | 2-3 days | 1, 2 | High — payment reliability |
